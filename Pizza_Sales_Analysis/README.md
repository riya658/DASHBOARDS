# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
## Problem Statement
The aim of this project was to create a comprehensive dashboard to analyze pizza sales data, identify key performance metrics, trends, and areas for improvement. The goal was to provide actionable insights to increase sales and optimize operations for a pizza restaurant.

## Task
The task was to develop a Pizza Sales Analysis dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard needed to visualize the sales data, highlight trends, identify popular items, and provide insights into sales performance across different time periods and customer segments.

## Action
1. Data Collection and Preparation:
- Gathered sales data from the restaurant's point-of-sale system, including information on sales transactions, customer demographics, product details, and sales timestamps.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python (Pandas) to handle missing values, correct data formats, and create derived columns for analysis.

2. Dashboard Development:
- Utilized Power BI to create interactive visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and heat maps, to represent various sales metrics.
- Designed key metrics such as total sales, average order value, sales by product category, sales by time of day, and customer demographics.
- Implemented filters and slicers to enable dynamic exploration of data based on different criteria such as date ranges, product categories, and customer segments.

3. Insights and Analysis:
- Analyzed sales trends to identify peak sales periods and popular menu items.
- Investigated customer preferences based on demographic data to tailor marketing strategies.
- Monitored the impact of promotions and discounts on sales performance.

## Result
The Pizza Sales Analysis dashboard provided the restaurant with valuable insights into their sales performance. Key findings included:

- Identification of peak sales periods (e.g., weekends and Friday/Saturday evenings).
- Recognition of top-selling pizza varieties (e.g., The Classic, The Pepperoni) and less popular ones (e.g., The Brie, The Calabrese).
- Understanding of customer preferences for pizza categories and sizes.
- The ability to track the effectiveness of promotional activities.

## Conclusion
1. Revenue Insights: The total revenue of 694.33K and an average order value of 38.34 indicate a strong performance in pizza sales. The Classic, Pepperoni, Barbecue, Hawaiian, and Thai 
   pizzas are the top revenue generators, each contributing significantly to the total revenue.

2. Sales Volume: With 42,096 pizzas sold across 18,111 orders, the average of 2.32 pizzas per order shows that customers typically order more than one pizza per transaction.

3. Order Trends:
- Daily Trends: Orders peak on Fridays, suggesting that marketing efforts and promotions could be focused on weekends to maximize sales.
- Monthly Trends: The months of May and July show the highest order volumes, possibly due to holidays or promotional events. December has the lowest order volume, which might need a review of marketing strategies during this period.
4. Category and Size Preferences:

- Pizza Categories: The sales distribution is relatively balanced among different categories, with Chicken slightly leading.
- Pizza Sizes: Large pizzas are the most popular, indicating customer preference for larger portions.
- Underperforming Pizzas: The Chicken, Italian, Spinach, California, and Brie pizzas are the lowest in revenue, which may require a review of their recipes, pricing, or promotional 
 strategies to boost their sales.

- Regional and Segment Analysis: The filter section suggests that the dashboard can analyze data based on region and customer segments (e.g., Central, East, South, West, Consumer, Corporate, Home Office). This could provide more tailored insights when applied.

## Recommendations:
- Focus on High-Performing Days: Increase marketing efforts and promotions on weekends, especially Fridays, to capitalize on peak ordering times.

- Seasonal Promotions: Develop special promotions for slower months like December to boost sales. Leverage the high order months (May and July) with targeted campaigns to maintain the momentum.

- Review Low-Performing Pizzas: Analyze the reasons behind the lower sales of certain pizzas and consider modifications in recipes, pricing, or marketing strategies.

- Optimize Pizza Sizes: Given the preference for large pizzas, ensure sufficient stock and consider bundle deals to encourage higher sales.

- Segmented Marketing: Utilize the filters to conduct a segmented analysis and develop targeted marketing strategies for different regions and customer segments.
